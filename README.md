# ♟️ notChess.com — A Functional Chessboard Interface

A fun little **/Next.js** project built for a technical assessment.

This project demonstrates component reusability, accessibility, and clean architecture while rendering a fully interactive **8×8 chessboard** with all pieces in their starting positions.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Core Requirements

- ♟️ **8×8 Chessboard** rendered using reusable components (`<Board />`, `<Square />`, `<Piece />`)
- 🧩 **Reusable piece components** — each chess piece is represented by an SVG icon
- 🎯 **Interactive highlights** — click or keyboard-focus a square to highlight it

- 💅 **Built with Next.js and modular CSS**

### 🌈 Bonus Features

- 🌗 **Light & Dark Mode Toggle**
  Switch between light and dark themes dynamically.
- 🪵 **Two Board Skins**

## 🧠 Design Notes

* The UI and components follow **composition over inheritance** — every piece and square is a standalone, reusable unit.
* Accessibility and keyboard control are built-in with ARIA labels.
* Theming is achieved via CSS variables controlled by React state.
* Additional features (light/dark themes and board skins) demonstrate **scalability** and **design flexibility**.
